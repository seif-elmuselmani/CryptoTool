## 🚀 Key Features

This tool offers a robust implementation of various cryptographic techniques:

### 🏛️ Classical Ciphers (The Foundation)
* **Substitution:** Caesar, Monoalphabetic, Vigenère.
* **Polygraphic:** **Playfair Cipher** (Implementation of 5x5 Matrix & Digraph rules).
* **Transposition:** Row Transposition, Rail Fence.
* **Matrix-Based:** Hill Cipher (Linear Algebra operations).
* **Unbreakable:** One-Time Pad (OTP).

### 🛡️ Modern Standards (The Powerhouse)
* **DES (Data Encryption Standard):** Full 16-round Feistel network implementation.
* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** The global standard for secure communication.
* **Security Modes:** Supports **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)** mode for enhanced security to prevent pattern leakage.
